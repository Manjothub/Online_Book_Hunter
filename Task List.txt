Project Information
There are 2 Roles

Mainly this Project focuses on the School Librarry where 
Student
a) can view books
b)request their fav books
c)comment on their fav books 
d)Rate them as per their opinion


on the other hand the HOD can 
 a) Read the students request and respond them
 b) he can add the books as per the student choices or the request 
 c) He can Manage all the students and the books 

 Now the Project is just completed the basic requirements of the students.
some points are not implemented on this project so from now onwards we are focusing on the pending points like:
1) Student can only view the books and request them but not download them so their should be a download button for that particular book that the student has requested.
2) If Student forgots their password so it cannot reset it.so their should be a password reset button to reset the password
3) Teacher can set the time period for the books that if the student doesn't return book on given time so he can fine them as per the day increase and he can set the charges to be increase day by day or weekly
4) Design should be updated 
5) HOD can Dynamically add and remove the banners and all th things to attract the students
6) Categories Should be Infinity so that the user can choose them widely
7) Student can send query to the teacher 
More points will be added soon as per the design implementation
